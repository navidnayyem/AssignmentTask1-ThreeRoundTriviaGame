Create an three-round trivia game in Android using ListView and Timer. There will only be 2 activities. The layout of the first activity will be as follows-
Round 1 (TextView)
ListView
EditText	Button

The current round number will be displayed in a TextView at the top. The ListView will randomly choose 5 countries from a list and display them in every round. You must highlight each of these countries, type the name of its capital in the EditText and click the Button to earn points. After a countryâ€™s capital has been correctly guessed, the ListView must be updated to remove the country. The timer class will advance the game to the next round every 20 seconds.
After the third round, the timer will send you to the second activity. Your score should be displayed in a TextView in the second activity.
